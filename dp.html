                <p class="mb-5">My dear Leos, I’d like to leave you with these words of advice. Be supportive, be genuine, be
                    hard working and give everything your best from the bottom of your heart and never expect anything in
                    return. It is my belief that we should be living with a pure heart by sharing with and caring about each
                    other, to look after our community. Therefore, do keep that in mind and provide your best contributions
                    to the movement and to the society in the upcoming years as well.</br>
                    Wish you all a wonderful Leoistic Year ahead!
                </br>
                    Be Bright, Be Brave &amp; Be beautiful!.</p>

                    was well groomed under the guidance of her teachers and mentors and roots of a remarkable journey
                    were planted. Not limiting her endless capabilities to academics she excelled herself in extracurricular
                    activities as well. She was engaged in Athletics and Netball during her School tenure. She was also a
